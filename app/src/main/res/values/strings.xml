        Spined is an application aimed to help people improve their cervical spine posture. This app has been developed after various studies had been conducted. On a sample size of 100, the study found commendable results. Spined employs novel technology that fetches raw accelerometer data and process it through a series of filters and algorithms. Past research usually takes two sensors to find the orientation of the phone; however, we have done it using a single sensor.
